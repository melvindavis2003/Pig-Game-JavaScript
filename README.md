# Pig-Game-JavaScript
This project involves the development of a simple, yet engaging, "Pig Game" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The implementation leverages HTML for the structure of the game interface, CSS for the design and styling, and JavaScript for the game logic, interactivity, and state management. The game features responsive design, intuitive controls, and smooth transitions to enhance user experience. Key features include real-time score updates, a visual representation of the dice rolls, and dynamic feedback for the players. This project serves as an example of integrating front-end web technologies to create a functional and entertaining game.
